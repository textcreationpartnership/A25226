            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE words, <hi>Repreſenting</hi> and <hi>Miſrepreſenting,</hi> have of late made a great noiſe among us; ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion having made it their buſineſs to perſuade the World, that we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have entertained a very ſtrange and falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of their Religion, and according to our own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, repreſented it as theirs, which they tell us is downright <hi>Miſrepreſenting.</hi> It is not my deſign to engage in this Controverſie, it hath been ſufficiently done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, and ſo ſufficiently, that the Anſwerer in his Anſwer to the <hi>Amicable Accommodation,</hi> I think had good reaſon to ſay, that the matter was drove as far as it would bear. Nor is it my intent to juſtify every thing, which, in heat of diſcourſe or diſputation, hath been charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Church by ſome of our own men; for though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they have ſaid no more than what they have warrant for from ſome eminent Schoolmen or Caſuiſts of that Church, yet I do not think it reaſonable that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinions of private men, though never ſo eminent in their way, ſhould be charged upon the whole Society of which they are Members, unleſs they have been owned by ſome publick and authentick act of that Society. Being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therefore to run my ſelf upon that Rock, I have ſteered another Courſe, and have made choice of one of the moſt ſolemn, publick and authentick Acts of their Church. <hi>Viz.</hi> The Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. printed with the Acts of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſhall charge nothing upon them but what is owned and contained therein. This Bull was dated at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year of our Lord 1564. in the Ides of <hi>November,</hi> and the Fifth year of his Pontificat. In this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52953:3"/>
Bull a Form of Faith is drawn up, extracted out of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which every one who enters into Holy Orders is bound by Oath not onely to believe, but to maintain and defend, and teach the people under their charge, and that under pain of the diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and of his holy Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> And if we may not take this for the Standard of their Faith and Religion, I muſt confeſs I do not know where to find it. But I do not know that this ever was, nor do I think it will now be diſowned by them, and therefore from hence you may take a proſpect of their Religion, and ſee what it is that will be required of thoſe who joyn in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them.</p>

               <p>Thus far his Holineſs thought fit to hold a good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with Primitive Chriſtianity, and thus far we can keep pace with him; All theſe Articles we willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and firmly believe, becauſe we have good warrant from the holy Scriptures ſo to do. But if the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Church ſhall preſume to decree any thing againſt the written Word of God, or beſides the ſame, and impoſe it as a new Article of Faith neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in order to our Salvation, we muſt beg their pardon, if we cannot ſo readily comply with them. For as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Authour, ſo we believe he is the Finiſher of our Faith. And as he perfectly knew the whole mind and will of his Father, ſo did he carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the ſame to his Apoſtles and Diſciples: For, ſaith he, <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, have I made known to you.</hi> John 15.15. And as we believe that the Apoſtles were inſtructed and commiſſionated by him to preach that Faith which they received from him; ſo we have no reaſon to doubt but that they did faithfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame to their Succeſſors, the Primitive Fathers of the Chriſtian Church; nor need we to queſtion but that the ſame Faith hath been carefully conveyed to us, both as it lies diſperſed in the holy Scriptures, and as it is ſumm'd up in thoſe three ancient Creeds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nicene, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſian, and that commonly called the Apoſtles Creed. Whatſoever therefore we do not find in theſe Creeds, nor contained in holy Scriptures, nor can be proved thereby, we dare not receive it as an Article of Faith, nor can we think it neceſſary to Salvation. And here we are left behind, not being able any farther to keep pace with the Church of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52953:4"/>
                  <hi>Rome;</hi> but we may comfort our ſelves in this, that we are left in good company, having Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and the Primitive Fathers with us. Here therefore let us take up our ſtand, and from hence take a view of Popery in the following Articles.</p>

                  <note>Though Chriſt, by being once offered, hath put away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore need not to be offered again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. yet you muſt believe that he is daily offered, and it may be in 10000 places at once, a true, proper, and propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick and the dead. And why ſhould you not believe ſo, ſeeing the Catholick (<hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick) Church hath defined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be ſo? If you ſay that you find nothing for it, but much againſt it in holy Scripture, this is to appeal from the Judgment of the Church to your own, which by no means muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But how do you know that there is any thing in Scripture againſt it? you will tell me you ſee and reade it there. But do you think it is fit for you to truſt your own eyes againſt ſo plain a declaration of the Church? Becauſe you ſee and feel and taſte, and thereupon judge a conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hoſt to be really Bread ſtill, do you think it is fit for you to believe ſo, when the Church hath told you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Have a care, this is a dangerous point. If you will be a true Catholick, you muſt reſolve to renounce all the evidence of Senſe and Reaſon, in this matter, and to live by an implicit faith.</note>

               <p>Thus have I given you a Proſpect of Popery without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſrepreſentation or prevarication, from a very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Record; <hi>viz.</hi> The Creed of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. which is received, profeſſed, and ſworn to by every one who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into Holy Orders in that Church; and in the cloſe thereof we are told, that the Faith contained therein is ſo abſolutely and indiſpenſibly neceſſary, that no man can be ſaved without it. The Creed it ſelf, you ſee, contains Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Articles. The Twelve firſt of which, we firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and readily embrace, being well aſſured that they contain nothing in them but Primitive Chriſtianity, and that they are well warranted by the Word of God. The Twelve latter we reject as Innovations and Additions to the Catholick Faith, that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints, and which hath been delivered down to us in the holy Scriptures, and the Three Ancient Creeds. In theſe you have the main Body of Popery, as it ſtands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Primitive Chriſtianity; the Novelty and

unwarrantableneſs whereof it were no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, but that hath been done already by better hands, and was no part of my deſign in theſe Papers.

And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this done, I have onely this requeſt to make, that thoſe, into whoſe hands theſe Papers ſhall come, would ſit down, and ſeriouſly conſider, whether it be fit or ſafe for them, to mingle ſuch ſtuff with their Common Chriſtianity.</p>
